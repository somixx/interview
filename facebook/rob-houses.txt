#  You are trying to rob houses on a street. Each house has some positive amount of cash. Your goal is to rob houses such that you
# maximize the total robbed amount. The constraint is once you rob a house you cannot rob a house adjascent to that house. 

values: p_0 ...p_N

key relation for value function:

V[i] = max value for houses 0..i.

V[j+1] = max(V[j], V[j-1] + p_{j+1})   for j>=1

V[0] = p_0
V[1] = max(p_0, p_1)
