“Function to compute the number of ways to climb a flight of n steps. Taking 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time.
Do it in Linear time and constant space.

n = 3.
1 1 1
1 2
2 1
3
Ans = 4”

f(1) = 1  -> f[0]
f(2) = 2  -> f[1]
f(3) = 4  -> f[2]
f(n+3) = f(n) + f(n+1) + f(n+2)

for i in range(n):
  ind = i % 3
  f[ind] = f[0] + f[1] + f[2]
